Extension Interface
===================

### Description

This interface defines any additional context elements that help describe the activity. The extension layer preserves fields that were not essential to describing the subject or activity, but are still represented in the log source. Extensions can contain two definitions. One contains schema fields, which are the fields required for any log from a given data source. The other definition contains activity type mapping, which includes the fields required for a specific activity type from a given data source.
