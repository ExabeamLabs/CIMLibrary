Common Information Model
========================
Welcome to the Exabeam common information model.

The Information model defines the structure of security content across Exabeam products. The hierarchical framework informs every aspect of security content usage throughout the flow of Exabeam processes.

The common information model includes a set of layered interfaces that each inherit the configuration of the previous layer. Together they create a complete picture of an event, according to the information model. Note that, with this layered approach, if an element is shown with an empty field array, it is by design because the element's field structure is defined in another interface. For more information, see [Common Information Modelâ€‹](https://docs.exabeam.com/en/content/all/exabeam-security-content/182296-security-content-in-the-cim-structure.html#UUID-0a6f25e0-a3cf-c844-0ac8-7c9ff7b0e2ee)
